Alright guys so here's how the repos gonna work.
It was my fault it messed up before, but now that we've got a new one we've gotta make sure it's clean this time


1. Work in your own scene. Merging scenes just doesn't work well.
2. Only work in files, or copied files that you've created. Merging scripts is a pain.
3. If you have questions, talk on the slack.


What we need done:
-Story manager: DJ
-Dialogue manager: DJ
-Overworld movement: Sam
-Animations & such: Matt
-NPC Dialogue Switching/Conditions: Issac
